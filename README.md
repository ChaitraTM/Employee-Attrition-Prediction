# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction and Analysis

This project predicts whether an employee will **stay or leave** a company using **Machine Learning**.  
It also includes a **Tableau dashboard** for visualizing the results.

## üìò Project Overview

Employee attrition means when employees leave the company.  
High attrition increases the cost of hiring and training new people.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze employee data and understand factors that cause attrition.
- Build a machine learning model to predict attrition.
- Show insights and predictions in a Tableau dashboard.

## üß© Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
- Dataset used: **HR-Employee-Attrition.csv**
- Columns include: Age, Salary, Job Role, Gender, Department, Overtime, etc.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary columns like: `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`, `StandardHours`, etc.
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Encoded categorical data using `LabelEncoder` (for Gender, Department, etc.).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized employee trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- Attrition by Department  
- Attrition by Salary  
- Attrition by Overtime  
- Attrition by Gender  
- Correlation Heatmap  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
- Trained models like:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated model using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score

   üìà Model Evaluation Example
   Metric	Score
   Accuracy	0.85
   Precision	0.82
   Recall	0.78
   F1-Score	0.80
   üß† Key Insights
  -Highest attrition occurs in Sales and R&D departments.
  -Employees doing Overtime are more likely to leave.
  -Younger employees (age 25‚Äì35) and those with low salary have higher attrition risk.
  -Model gives around 85% accuracy in predicting attrition.
